Some Additional GDB Commands
    (gdb) break or b: Set a breakpoint as we have done before.
    (gdb) disable breakpoint number
    (gdb) enable breakpoint number
    (gdb) delete breakpoint number
    (gdb) continue or c: Continue execution until next breakpoint.
    (gdb) step or s: Step into the current line, eventually jumping into the called function.
    (gdb) next or n: Step over the current line and stop at the next line.
    (gdb) help or h: Show help.
    (gdb) tui enable: Enable a simple text user interface; to disable, use tui disable.
    (gdb) print or p: Print the value of a variable, register, and so on.
    Here are some examples:
    Print rax: (gdb) p $rax.
    Print rax in binary: (gdb) p/t $rax.
    Print rax in hexadecimal: (gdb) p/x $rax.

One important remark about GDB: to properly use it, you must insert a
function prologue and a function epilogue in your code.
