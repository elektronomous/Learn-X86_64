Put the format string in rdi, point rsi to the item to be printed, put 0 
into rax to indicate that no floating-point numbers are involved, and then
call printf. For printing a floating-point number, move the floating-point
value to be displayed in xmm0, with the instruction movq . We use one xmm
register, so we put 1 into rax.

Note the square brackets, [ ], around radius and pi.
    mov rsi, [radius]
This means: take the content at address radius and put it in rsi.

The function printf wants a memory address for strings, but for numbers it
expects a value, not a memory address. Keep that in mind.
